# product-dashboard

I've created a complete frontend web application with dummy data! Here's what it includes:
Features:

50 randomly generated products with realistic data (names, prices, stock levels, sales, etc.)
Interactive dashboard with stats cards showing key metrics
Search functionality to filter products by name
Category filtering across 6 different product categories
Sorting options by name, price, or sales
Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
Visual indicators for stock status and sales trends

The dummy data includes:

Product IDs, names, categories
Pricing and stock information
Sales figures and trends
Status indicators (In Stock, Low Stock, Out of Stock)
Star ratings

You can easily customize this by:

Modifying the generateProducts() function to create different types of data
Changing the categories, statuses, or other fields
Adjusting the number of products generated
Adding more fields like images, descriptions, or dates

This is fully open source and ready to use! Would you like me to add any specific features, change the data structure, or create a different type of application (like a user management system, blog, or task tracker)?Claude is AI and can make mistakes.
