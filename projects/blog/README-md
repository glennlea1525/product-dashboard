Blog Platform with Dummy DataInteractive artifact ∙ Version 2 Perfect! I've created a complete blog platform with dummy data. Here's what it includes:

## Features:

- 25 blog posts with realistic tech-related titles and content
- Author profiles with 8 different authors
- Tagging system with 14+ categories (JavaScript, React, CSS, etc.)
- Interactive dashboard with stats for total posts, views, likes, and featured posts
- Search functionality to find posts by title or author
- Tag filtering to browse by category
- Sorting options (latest, most popular, most liked)
- Post details view - click any post to see the full article
- Engagement metrics - likes, comments, views, and read time
- Featured posts highlighting
- Responsive grid layout

## The dummy data includes:

- Post titles and excerpts
- Author names
- Publication dates (randomized over past 90 days)
- Multiple tags per post
- Like counts, comment counts, view counts
- Read time estimates
- Featured post status

You can easily customize this by modifying the `generateBlogPosts()` function to add different titles, authors, tags, or content types. 

The platform is fully interactive and ready to use as a starting point for your open source project!
